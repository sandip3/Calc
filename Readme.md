# Basic Calculator

## Overview
- A simple Python application for basic arithmetic operations.
- Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **OOP**: Design approach for modular and reusable code.

## Features

### Basic Operations (Two or More Inputs)
- **Addition**: Add two or more numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two or more numbers.
- **Division**: Divide one number by another (handles division by zero).

### Advanced Operations (Single Input)
- **Exponentiation**: Raise a number to a power.
- **Square Root**: Calculate the square root of a number.

### Trigonometric Functions (Single Input)
- **Sine (sin)**: Compute the sine of an angle.
- **Cosine (cos)**: Compute the cosine of an angle.
- **Tangent (tan)**: Compute the tangent of an angle.

### Logarithmic Functions (Single Input)
- **Natural Log (ln)**: Calculate the natural logarithm of a number.
- **Common Log (log10)**: Calculate the common logarithm (base 10) of a number.
