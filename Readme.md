- **OOP**: A design approach that promotes modular and reusable code.

## ‚ú® Features

### Basic Operations (Two or More Inputs)
- **Addition**: Add two or more numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two or more numbers.
- **Division**: Divide one number by another (handles division by zero).

### Advanced Operations (Single Input)
- **Exponentiation**: Raise a number to a specified power.
- **Square Root**: Calculate the square root of a number.

### Trigonometric Functions (Single Input)
- **Sine (sin)**: Compute the sine of an angle.
- **Cosine (cos)**: Compute the cosine of an angle.
- **Tangent (tan)**: Compute the tangent of an angle.

### Logarithmic Functions (Single Input)
- **Natural Log (ln)**: Calculate the natural logarithm of a number.
- **Common Log (log10)**: Calculate the common logarithm (base 10).

### Additional Functions
- **Pi (œÄ)**: Get the value of œÄ multiplied by a number.
- **Percentage (%)**: Calculate a part's percentage relative to a total.
- **Inverse (1/x)**: Compute the reciprocal of a number.
- **Euler's Number (e)**: Get Euler's number multiplied by a number.
