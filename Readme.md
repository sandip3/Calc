# Basic Calculator

## Overview
A simple Python application designed for a variety of arithmetic operations, built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **OOP**: A design approach that promotes modular and reusable code.

## Features

### Basic Operations (Two or More Inputs)
- **Addition**: Add two or more numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two or more numbers.
- **Division**: Divide one number by another (includes handling of division by zero).

### Advanced Operations (Single Input)
- **Exponentiation**: Raise a number to a specified power.
- **Square Root**: Calculate the square root of a number.

### Trigonometric Functions (Single Input)
- **Sine (sin)**: Compute the sine of an angle.
- **Cosine (cos)**: Compute the cosine of an angle.
- **Tangent (tan)**: Compute the tangent of an angle.

### Logarithmic Functions (Single Input)
- **Natural Log (ln)**: Calculate the natural logarithm of a number.
- **Common Log (log10)**: Calculate the common logarithm (base 10) of a number.

### Additional Functions
- **Pi (π)**: Get the value of π multiplied by a number.
- **Percentage (%)**: Calculate the percentage of a part relative to a total.
- **Inverse (1/x)**: Compute the reciprocal of a number.
- **Euler's Number (e)**: Get Euler's number multiplied by a number.
